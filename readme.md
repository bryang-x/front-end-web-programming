*Details:* Deploy a website to GitHub as a static site.
*Requirements:* Deploy a website or application to a new GitHub repository. This is done by utilizing GitHub pages. We will use this frequently this semester for deploying projects, so we will use this project to get in the habit of using Git for version control and deployment.

## Node Projects

### Lab 3: Mad Libs Project

*Deliverable:* Build a webpage that takes 10+ inputs and submits them into a Mad Libs style story. Syllabus for IDSN 599, Page 3
*Details:* There are a few ways to do this but leveraging jQuery to collect the form values and then populate the story is the ideal outcome. We shouldn’t need to do any form processing on the server side. Consider something fun.

### Lab 4: Dependency Management – HR Directory

*Deliverable:* Take an existing web project and convert the HTML to React JSX. Publish this to GitHub. Syllabus for IDSN 599, Page 4
*Details:* This should be an existing project, and ideally be broken into several components. Use Create React App as a starter. As an example, you should have several pages that share components. Each of these components would have props that could be passed to change the dynamic content. (Page titles in the header, as an example.)
#### Pages:
* Home
* About
* Contact
* Gallery

#### Components
* Header
* Footer
* Navbars
* Etc.

### Lab 9: React Routing
*Deliverable:* Add client-side routing to the project from Lab 8.

### Assignment 1.1: Pitch Deck
*Deliverable:* Document (proposal), including screenshots/wireframes
*Details:* Written (text, narrative) proposal of the website, as well as mock-ups, wireframes, and/or screenshots of a version of the landing page.
Each student will present their proposal in class in week 11.

### Assignment 1.2: Application and Layout
